Site 1

What is the URL?<br> https://www.reddit.com/r/superman/
<br>
How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc? It was an autocomplete for me, as I visit the site fairly consistently. I am one of the moderators.
<br>
How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way? It looks fairly current, as Reddit recently went through a redesign that was met with some controversy, as it seemed to water-down the aesthetic, however, it has grown on me. As for the Superman personalization, I may be too attached to it, as I was a major hand in the recent redesign to the entire subreddit.
<br>
Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things?<br>I feel it is fairly easy to navigate, Reddit has a fairly robust navigation system, easy to find where to go for whatever you are looking to do on that given subreddit, or to navigate away.
<br>
What parts of the site are interactive? Nearly all, the icon, the links have a level of interactivity, each item has some level to it that is reponsive in someway, I think
